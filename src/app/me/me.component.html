                Hey, my name Jeremy, but most people call me JJ. I'm a young enthusiastic software developer. I am
                currently doing an apprenticeship as a computer
                scientist specializing in application development. I love working as a software developer because every
                assignment is unique. I always take every assignment very seriously. I work very professionally and
                efficiently. I'm also uncomplicated and open to ideas and suggestions for improvement. That you are
                satisfied with the assignment has the highest priority for me.
